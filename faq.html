          <!-- question module goes here -->
          <h4>What can I learn from this website?</h4>

<p>The USDA estimates that 133 billion pounds of food available for human consumption in the U.S. was not eaten. That is 31 percent of all the food.</p>

<p>Our goal with our project was simple: to visualize the American diet, and show how much food waste is created. </p>

<p>A great deal of waste that the average consumer could prevent, by cooking smaller portions, learning how to properly story foodstuffs and eating leftovers. </p>

<h4>Where do the numbers come from?</h4>

<p>We used data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's <a href="http://ers.usda.gov/">Economic Research Service</a>. </p>

<p><a href="http://ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-availability-(per-capita)-data-system/.aspx#26705">Take a closer look at the data that we used.</a> Here is a <a href="https://github.com/frankbi/food-wasted-youth/blob/master/scripts/consumer_loss.csv">simplified table version</a> that we used for the project.</p>

<p>Here is some <a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-availability-%28per-capita%29-data-system/loss-adjusted-food-availability-documentation.aspx#.U2ZPaq1dVe5">documentation</a> on how the "Loss-Adjusted Food Availability" data was collected by the ERS. </p>

<p>-- Table of food items with <a href="https://github.com/frankbi/food-wasted-youth/blob/master/foodtable.csv">largest and least amounts of food waste</a></p>


<h4>What are ways this idea could be taken further?</h4>


<p>-- Allowing users to customize the plate to reflect their eating habits and diet</p>
<p>-- Create plates based on popular diets (i.e. South Beach, Paleo, vegetarian etc.) and see which diet is the most and/or least wasteful</p>
<p>-- Compare the amount of wasted crops to the lost revenue of wasted crops</p>


<h4>Do you have any ideas, comments or other questions?</h4>

<p>Email our team at NatGeo-ScrapStats [AT] googlegroup [DOT] com and tell us how we can make this project better.</p>

<h4>What can I do to reduce my food waste?</h4>

<p>Read a <a href="http://www2.epa.gov/recycle/reducing-wasted-food-basics">primer on the basics of reducing waste</a> from the Environmental Protection Agency. </p>

<p>Educate yourself: Learn more why this matters at <a href="http://food.nationalgeographic.com/">NatGeoFood.com</a>, where you can explore issues surrounding how we eat today and how we can provide food for all as the worldâ€™s population grows and climate change impacts growing seasons and planting zones.</p>
